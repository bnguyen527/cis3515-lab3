Lab assignments for Mobile Development course. Involves creating a custom adapter and very basic launcher icons and experiencing with resource files, fragments, and their interactions with activities.

Application will allow a user to see a list of colors in a dropdown list, where the background color for each list item will be the color listed in the associated text. When the user selects a color from the list, a fragment will be launched on the same screen with the color as its background color (on top of existing fragments, if any). The user can also go back to previous selected colors using back button.

The application is also supported in Spanish.
